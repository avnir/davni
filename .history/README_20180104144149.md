Hey duder. 

Let me know when you fork/clone this so I can delete this repo :)

Anywho ... lets get started. 

A few quick things to note. 

1. Something like this I'd probably create a microservice to serve up the pdfs. Basically, a website you can curl that will generate the contents and then let you download it(even if it is programatically). I can show you how I'd do that if you're interested ...
