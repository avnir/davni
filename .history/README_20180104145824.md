Hey duder. 

Let me know when you fork/clone this so I can delete this repo :)

Anywho ... lets get started. 

A few quick things to note. 

1. Something like this I'd probably create a microservice to serve up the pdfs. Basically, a website you can curl that will generate the contents and then let you download it(even if it is programatically). I can show you how I'd do that if you're interested, but basically I'd use [Crush](https://github.com/kcmerrill/crush) or some similiar [FAAS](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=faas&type=)


2. I'm going to show you the "wrong" way first, only so you can see something I found really cool with docker. Basically, you mount the docker binary from your host machine inside a container(that doesn't have docker installed), along with it's socket. This lets you play with docker inside a container, without actually installing anything inside the container. It also is neat because whenever you exec `docker` it's running on the `host` machine, and not in the container. I'm on a mac, but this should work for all `*nix` env's. 

3. I'll also show you the right way. What you're looking for is a thing called data volumes. Read more about them [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/volumes/#create-and-manage-volumes). The TL;DR is that docker creates a "container" and it's soul purpose in life is to store data that multiple containers can read from. So, you can create a volume mounted folder, lets for our example use `/pdfs` in both of our services, so anytime data gets written into `/pdfs` all the containers that have that volume can see it as if it were a regular directory. 

# First Example

Probably the easiest. I think you already know how to shell out in go lang, if not, it looks like this:

```golang
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os/exec"
)

func main() {
    // local /tmp/pdfs ->container /pdfs
    // notice, /tmp/pdfs .... this binary is running INSIDE a container
	cmd := exec.Command("sh", "-c", "docker run --rm -v /tmp/pdfs:/pdfs -w /pdfs madnight/docker-alpine-wkhtmltopdf", "google.com", "google.pdf")
	stdoutStderr, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Printf("%s\n", stdoutStderr)
}
```

But here is the secret sauce. When you run a container(alpine images are wonky, some quick googling you should be able to figure this out for alpine, but for time sake i'm going to use an ubuntu based container).

```-v /usr/bin/docker:/usr/bin/docker -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock```

So, that will volume mount the docker binary ... and it will also volume mount the docker socket so when you're _inside_ the container, and you run `docker run` whatever, it's as if you're running docker on your host machine, even though you're inside the container. 

Give this command a go. 
```docker run -ti --rm -v /usr/bin/docker:/usr/bin/docker -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ubuntu```

Now, hop into the container, and play around with docker. Keep in mind, it's as if you're running docker on the _HOST_ machine. 

Here is what mine looks like:

```sh
02:52 PM âœ” kcmerrill  davni ] docker run -ti --rm -v /usr/bin/docker:/usr/bin/docker -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ubuntu
root@51dad591094b:/# docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
51dad591094b        ubuntu              "/bin/bash"         3 seconds ago       Up 3 seconds                            hopeful_lichterman
root@51dad591094b:/#
```

One quick note, mine just worked, so yours should too, but if you're getting a weird error, about not able to talk to the docker socket, or something .... try running this: `apt-get update && apt-get install -y libltdl7` and then try again.
